    <h1>Level 1: Projectile Motion</h1>
    <p class="explanations">
      Note: The explanation of the concept here does not take into account air
      resistance and drag.
      <br />
      <br />

      Motion of a projectile combines the physics of kinematics with the maths
      of a parabola. The motion of projectile is defined by the laws of
      kinematics, namely v = u + at s ut + 1/2(at2) v2 = u2 + 2as where
      <br />

      <br />
      u => initial velocity of the projectile,<br />
      v => velocity of the projec tile at time ‚Äút‚Äù (final velocity)
      <br />
      a=> constant acceleration/ deceleration<br />
      t => time elapsed <br />s => displacement (change in position in a given
      time ‚Äút‚Äù)

      <br /><br />
      The projectile could be launched at any angle; thus, the initial velocity,
      Vector u will be at an angle ‚ÄúX‚Äù to the horizontal. Vector u can be split
      into 2 components - u*cosX in the horizontal direction and u*sinX in the
      vertical direction. Any motion in the vertical direction is subject to
      acceleration due to gravity; hence the vertical component of the velocity
      will change - it will reduce as the projectile goes up till it becomes 0
      at its maximum height and then the vertical velocity will increase in the
      opposite direction (down) till it hits the ground. Thus the vertical
      velocity constantly changes as per the above laws of kinematics. The
      horizontal velocity, on the other hand, does not change since there are no
      forces acting on the projectile in the horizontal direction. It is assumed
      to remain unchanged till the projectile hits the ground. Let us look at
      the equations that define this.
      <br />
      <br />
      Projectile Motion (parabolic): Time to reach maximum height.To derive
      this, we only need to consider the vertical velocity from the initial
      value to the point where it becomes 0. As the projectile is travelling
      upwards, the acceleration acting on it is ‚Äú-g‚Äù (negative g, acceleration
      due to earth).
      <br /><br />
      Initial velocity = usinX Final velocity = 0 <br />Acceleration = -g
      <br />Time = t 1st kinematic equation gives 0 = usinX - gt or t = u*sinX/g
      is the time to reach max height At maximum height (s), vertical velocity =
      0 <br /><br />
      0^2 = (usinX)2 - 2g*s s = u2sin2X/2g Total time of flight = 2*t =
      2u*sinX/g Total horizontal distance covered = horizontal velocity * total
      time of flight = u*cosX*2u*sinX/g = u2*2sinXcosX/g = u2*sin2X/g For a
      projectile motion with a given velocity, u & g are constants. Thus the
      maximum distance we can throw the projectile is dependent on our angle of
      throw. Given, the maximum Sin value is 1 when the angle is 90 degree, we
      can see that X has to be equal to 45 degree for the projectile to travel
      maximum horizontal distance (u2/g).

    <h1>Level 2 : Hydraulic's press</h1>
    <p class="explanations">
      Bramah's press, or Hydraulic press uses the principle of pressure
      transmission and force multiplier in a fluid to generate higher output
      forces for a relatively small input force. This is used extensively in the
      industry in multiple equipment like cranes to lift heavy loads with a
      lower force, machines to crush metal etc. The principle is simple - for an
      incompressible fluid, any applied pressure if transmitted equally
      throughout the fluid and in all directions. We all know Pressure = Applied
      Force / Area of application. Pressure is measured in N/m^2, also known as
      Pascals. Incompressible fluids are those where the volume and density do
      not change with change in pressure. Water is an incompressible fluid; oils
      are considered incompressible.
      <br /><br />
      Consider a hydraulic system with 2 piston-cylinder arrangement which are
      connected and filled with an incompressible oil. Let the area of the
      smaller cylinder be A1 and that of the larger cylinder be A2. On the
      smaller piston, let us apply a force F1. Let the output force on the
      larger piston be F2. Let us find the relation between F1 & F2. The applied
      force of F1 on the small piston results in a applied pressure of P = F1/
      A1. As per the principle of equal transmission of pressure, P is
      transmitted equally throughout the fluid in this interconnected piston
      cylinder system. Thus, the larger piston is also subject to the same
      pressure P which results in a force of P * A2. F2 = P * A2; P = F1 / A1 So
      F2 = F1 * (A2 / A1) Based on the relative sizes of A1 & A2, the force F2
      get multiplied several times over F1. This highlights the principle of the
      hydraulic press. This is very useful to help unlock the door, keep this in
      mind! To read through or watch through the training go to

    <h1>Level 3 : Lens</h1>
    <p class="explanations">
      For the purpose of this game & training, we are taking a thin, convex
      lens. Lenses are used in several places, from spectacles, to magnifying
      glasses, to telescopes, cameras, in car mirrors and so many more!
    </p>
    <h1 class="section_heading">Real & Virtual Images</h1>
    <p class="explanations">
      A lens always creates an image of an object. Before we dive right into the
      principles of image formation using lens, we should note that images
      formed by lends can be real or virtual. If the light rays emanating from
      an object converge after passing through the lens then we get a real
      image. Note a real image is always formed on the opposite side of a lens
      as opposed to the object. Real images can be cast on a screen and are
      smaller size than the object for convex lens. For certain positions of the
      object with respect to the lens, the rays do not converge after passing
      through the lens ‚Äì they diverge. In such cases, the rays appear to
      converge when traced back. Such images formed by tracing the rays back are
      called virtual images. They are always formed on the same side of the lens
      as the object. Virtual images are larger than the object in size and
      cannot be cast on a screen. In our daily life we see virtual images
      several times every day ‚Äì can you guess where? That is right ‚Ä¶.in the
      mirrors we use; every image we see in the mirror are virtual üòä Every lens
      has a corresponding focus on both sides of the lens. The focus on the
      point where rays parallel to the axis (rays from infinity) of the lens
      converge after passing through the lens. There is one crucial formula
      applicable to lenses and it will come extremely handy in the game, so make
      sure to remember this. The formula, also known as the lens-maker‚Äôs formula
      is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f, where v represents the image distance u represents the
      object distance f represents the focal length of the lens Note all the
      distances are measure from the pole (centre) of the lens. Now for getting
      the right result from using this formula, sign conventions are crucial.
      The object distance is always taken as negative since it is measured
      opposite to the direction of travel of light The image distance is taken
      as positive when the image is real, and negative when virtual, again based
      on the direction of measure & travel of light rays The Focal distance is
      positive in the case of a convex lens (just know that in a concave lens it
      is negative) Now you can just put the signs as given!
      <br />Alright, that is it for your training, Game On!!!!
